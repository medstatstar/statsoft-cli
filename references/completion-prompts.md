# Configuration Completion Prompts

> This document was extracted when SKILL.md was streamlined; it contains completion-prompt templates for each statistical software configuration.
> After software detection completes, the AI should output completion notices to the user following the templates below.

---

## SPSS

> ⚠️ **Important — daily usage recommendation**:
> - **For complex syntax runs → use Approach 1** (`stats.com` + `.spj`, foolproof)
> - **Approach 2** (internal Python driver) **can only run pure analysis syntax** and must not contain:
>   - `OUTPUT SAVE`, `OUTPUT EXPORT`, `OUTPUT DISPLAY`
>   - `HOST COMMAND`, `XDATA`, `XSAVE` (when OUTPUT objects are involved)
> - When unsure whether a command involves OUTPUT/SAVE → use Approach 1 (`.spj`) uniformly
>
> See SKILL.md core permissions section (Core Permissions) for SPSS invocation details.

## SPSS Modeler

- ✅ SPSS Modeler supports pure CLI execution via `clemb.exe`, completely GUI-free, no splash screen
- ⚠️ Windows-only, no macOS/Linux support
- 💡 Suitable for data mining, predictive modeling, ML pipelines

---

## Stata

```
✅ Stata association configuration complete!

⚠️ Important notes:
  1. **⚠️⚠️ Stata version and batch parameters (important)**:
     - **Stata 12 and earlier** → Windows: `/e do "script.do"`, Mac/Linux: `-e do "script.do"`
     - **Stata 13 and later** → Windows: `/b do "script.do"`, Mac/Linux: `-b do "script.do"`
     - ❌ **Wrong version parameter triggers a confirmation dialog!**
  2. Paths containing spaces must be wrapped in double quotes, otherwise a file not found error occurs
  3. **License match**: when invoking Stata you must use the executable matching the license
     - MP license → use StataMP-64.exe (Windows) or stata-mp (Mac/Linux)
     - SE license → use StataSE-64.exe (Windows) or stata-se (Mac/Linux)
     - BE license → use Stata-64.exe (Windows) or stata (Mac/Linux)
     - ❌ If the wrong edition is used (e.g., MP binary without an MP license), Stata fails to start or errors out
  4. **Edition feature differences**:
     - MP (Multiprocessing): multi-core parallelism, good for large data
     - SE (Special Edition): single-core, good for medium data
     - BE (Basic Edition): limited features, no parallelism
  5. **Version-specific changes**:
     - Stata 14/15: executables named StataMP, StataSE (no -64 suffix)
     - Stata 16+: executables named StataMP-64, StataSE-64 (added -64 suffix)
     - Stata 16+: supports Python integration (call Python from Stata)
     - Stata 17+: introduced PyStata (call Stata from Python)
     - Stata 19+: introduced StataNow rapid-update mechanism
  6. **Windows install path differences**:
     - Stata 14-18: `C:\Program Files\StataNN` (NN is the version number)
     - Stata 19: `C:\Program Files\Stata19` or `C:\Program Files\StataNow19`

📋 Recommended usage:
  # Windows (choose correct edition by license)
  "StataMP-64.exe" /b do "script.do"   # MP edition (Stata 16+)
  "StataSE-64.exe" /b do "script.do"   # SE edition (Stata 16+)
  "Stata-64.exe" /b do "script.do"     # BE edition (Stata 16+)
  "StataMP" /b do "script.do"          # MP edition (Stata 14/15)

  # Mac/Linux (choose correct edition by license)
  stata-mp -b do "script.do"   # MP edition
  stata-se -b do "script.do"   # SE edition
  stata -b do "script.do"      # BE edition
```

---

## R

```
✅ R connection configuration complete!

⚠️ Important notes:
  1. Use Rscript command for batch mode, not R GUI
  2. Installing R packages requires EXPLICIT user confirmation (downloads from CRAN, modifies local environment) before proceeding — do not install without it
  3. Chinese encoding issues: use fileEncoding="UTF-8" parameter
  4. Insufficient memory: use data.table or arrow packages for large data

📋 Recommended usage:
  Rscript --vanilla "script.R"

  # Package installation (requires explicit user confirmation before network download)
  Rscript -e "cat('Installing package from CRAN (requires network access)...\n'); install.packages('[PKG]', repos='https://cran.r-project.org')"

  # Read SPSS .sav file
  Rscript -e "library(haven); df <- read_sav('data.sav'); print(head(df))"

💡 Alternatives without R:
  If R is not installed, consider using Anaconda Python environment:
  - dplyr / tidyr → pandas
  - ggplot2 → matplotlib / seaborn
  - caret / xgboost → scikit-learn
  - survival → lifelines
  - lme4 / nlme → statsmodels
  - metafor → PyMC
```

---

## SAS

```
✅ SAS connection configuration complete!

⚠️ Important notes:
  1. Batch mode generates .log (log) and .lst (output listing) files, ensure write permissions
  2. Chinese encoding: add options encoding='utf-8'; at beginning of program
  3. SAS license expiration will cause ERROR: License expired

📋 Recommended usage:
  # Windows
  "sas.exe" -sysin "prog.sas" -log "out.log" -print "out.lst"

  # Mac/Linux
  sas -sysin "prog.sas" -log "out.log" -print "out.lst"
```

---

## JMP

- ⚠️ JMP may display a brief splash screen (1-2 seconds), cannot be fully avoided
- ⚠️ Script must end with `Exit();` or JMP GUI will remain open

> See [ADDITIONAL_SOFTWARE.md → JMP](../ADDITIONAL_SOFTWARE.md#jmp) for details

---

## GraphPad Prism

- ⚠️⚠️⚠️ GraphPad Prism **has no CLI mode**; invocation pops up the GUI (unavoidable)
- ⚠️ When used, the following occurs: GUI pops up on invocation, user must operate manually
- 🖱️ This skill only provides **detection + manual GUI-launch guidance**; it does not drive batch processing via CLI/headless

**Parsing-only alternative**:
| Approach | Description |
|------|------|
| Python `prismWriter` library | Can **parse** .pzfx structure (read/validate) without launching the GUI; the library itself also has the ability to **generate** .pzfx, but this skill **never calls or wraps any of its write operations** (consistent with command-examples.md: .pzfx read/write is outside this skill's allowed scope; if needed, do it manually outside this skill and take responsibility) |

h2o.init()                          # launches local H2O server (JVM)
h2o.import_file("data.csv")         # uploads dataset into the H2O service
# ... AutoML training ...
h2o.shutdown()                      # shut down the server
