|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Windows | ✅ | ✅ (batch mode) | ⚠️ May have splash screen |
| macOS | ❌ | ❌ | — |
| Linux | ❌ | ❌ | — |

### Batch Command

## GraphPad Prism

### Introduction

GraphPad Prism is scientific graphing and statistical analysis software, **does not have a CLI mode** — calling it will launch the GUI (unavoidable).

### Platform Support

| Platform | Supported | CLI Support | Splash Screen |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Windows | ✅ | ❌ (no CLI) | ⚠️⚠️⚠️ GUI only |
| macOS | ✅ | ❌ (no CLI) | ⚠️⚠️⚠️ GUI only |
| Linux | ❌ | ❌ | — |

### Installation Paths

**Windows**:
- `C:\Program Files\GraphPad\Prism 8\prism.exe`
- `C:\Program Files\GraphPad\Prism 9\prism.exe`
- `C:\Program Files\GraphPad\Prism 10\prism.exe`

**macOS**:
- `/Applications/GraphPad Prism.app/Contents/MacOS/GraphPad Prism`

### How to Launch (manual GUI launch only, no CLI batch)

> ⚠️ GraphPad Prism **has no CLI mode** and cannot be run silently/batch via command line.
> This skill does **not** provide any `prism.exe` command-line call, and does **not create or modify** any GraphPad Prism project/data files (including `.pzfx`); only the following are supported:
> 1. Manually double-click to open the GUI (or the user launches it themselves);
> 2. The user operates their project/data files within GraphPad Prism themselves.

### ⚠️ Important Limitation

GraphPad Prism **has no CLI mode**, calling it will launch the GUI. This differs from SPSS (Production Facility), R (Rscript), Stata (batch mode).

### Alternatives

- ⚠️ This skill does NOT support any automation that creates or modifies `.pzfx` files in the background (including Python `prismWriter`); such operations are out of scope and must be performed manually by the user in their own GraphPad Prism environment.

### Configuration Completion Notes

- ⚠️⚠️⚠️ No CLI mode — GUI launches when called (unavoidable)
- 💡 This skill provides detection and manual-launch guidance only; it NEVER creates or modifies Prism `.pzfx` project/data files

## JMP

### Introduction

JMP is an interactive visualization statistical software by SAS, supports JSL script batch processing (`/R` parameter), may have brief splash screen (1-2 seconds) when running.

### Platform Support

| Platform | Supported | CLI Support | Splash Screen |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Windows | ✅ | ✅ (`/R` parameter) | ⚠️ Brief (1-2 sec) |
| macOS | ✅ | ✅ (`/R` parameter) | ⚠️ Brief (1-2 sec) |
| Linux | ❌ | ❌ | — |

### Installation Paths

**Windows**:
- `C:\Program Files\SAS\JMP\JMP.exe`
- `C:\Program Files\JMP\JMP\JMP.exe`

**macOS**:
- `/Applications/JMP.app/Contents/MacOS/JMP`

### Batch Command

```powershell
# Windows
"JMP.exe" /R "script.jsl"

# macOS
JMP -R "script.jsl"
```

### JSL Script Template

```jsl
// script.jsl — JMP script
Clear Log();

// Read data
dt = Open("data.csv");

// Analysis
[AnalysisPlatform](
    Y(:column1),
    X(:column2)
);

// Save results
Save(dt, "results.jmp");
Close(dt, NoSave);

// Exit (batch mode)
Exit();
```

### ⚠️ Splash Screen Issue

JMP is a GUI application; even when using the `/R` batch mode, it may still display a startup splash screen when running. The splash screen lasts only briefly (1-2 seconds), and JMP will auto-close after the script finishes (if the script ends with `Exit();`).

### Notes

- ⚠️ **The script must end with `Exit();`**, otherwise the JMP GUI stays open
- **Compared with GraphPad**: GraphPad has no CLI at all, while JMP has a CLI (`/R` parameter) and supports batch processing

### Configuration Completion Notes

- ⚠️ JMP may show a brief splash screen (1-2 sec) when running, unavoidable
- ⚠️ The script must end with `Exit();`

## Statistica

### Introduction

Statistica is a data mining and machine learning software (Windows-only), has CLI support (SVB script batch processing), may have splash screen.

> ⚠️ **Detection-only + manual guidance (SDI-1 safety boundary)**: `setup_statistica.ps1` is detection-only and never writes `config.json`. Executing an SVB script goes through the guarded runner `statsoft-statistica.ps1` with a `Test-UserAuthorizedToRun` gate (same as SPSS/R runners).

### Platform Support

| Platform | Supported | CLI Support | Splash Screen |
|----------|-----------|-------------|---------------|
| Windows | ✅ | ✅ (SVB script) | ⚠️ May have splash screen |
| macOS | ❌ | ❌ | — |
| Linux | ❌ | ❌ | — |

### Detection & Manual-Guidance Notes

- ⚠️ `setup_statistica.ps1` detection-only, writes no config.json
- ⚠️ Executing an SVB requires the guarded runner + explicit confirmation
- ⚠️ Statistica batch mode may have splash screen
- ⚠️ Windows-only, no macOS/Linux support
- 💡 Suitable for data mining, ML, statistical analysis
